# bsmodinstaller.py
Downloads and installs Beat Saber SongLoader, SyncSaber &amp; Other Mods

# Instructions
Copy bsmodinstaller.py to your 'Beat Saber' directory and run it. Requires Python 3. Optionally, review script and disable mods that you don't want installed by setting "enabled" to False in the dictionary.

# TODO:
- Automatically detect if IPA.exe has already been run to prevent duplicate runs.
- Test and confirm that it can be run at every game launch to update the DLLs through Steam Launch Options without any major delays.
- Add more mods and an easy menu for selecting which mods to install.
